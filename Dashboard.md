## Explanation
This dashboard contains a summary of the 2019 NY Yellow Taxi Trips data. At the top there is a scorecard that contains the total trips, total passengers, and total revenue earned. Revenue here is calculated from a combination of fares and tips.
In the middle there is a line chart, the first is to compare the number of trips with the number of passengers in a time series and the second is to compare the fares received with the tips received in a time series. At the bottom there is a donut chart, first to compare the percentage of payment types, then to compare the percentages between taxi vendors, and finally to compare between stores and fwd.
